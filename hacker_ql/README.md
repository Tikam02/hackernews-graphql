# Graphql and Apollo


setup Apollo 


```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './styles/index.css';
import App from './components/App';


// 1
import {
  ApolloProvider,
  ApolloClient,
  createHttpLink,
  InMemoryCache
} from '@apollo/client';

// 2
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000'
});

// 3
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

// 4
ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
 
 ```



- We import all the dependencies we need to wire up the Apollo client, all from @apollo/client.
- We create the httpLink that will connect our ApolloClient instance with the GraphQL API. The GraphQL server will be running on http://localhost:4000.
- We instantiate ApolloClient by passing in the httpLink and a new instance of an InMemoryCache.
- Finally, we render the root component of our React app. The App is wrapped with the higher-order component ApolloProvider that gets passed the client as a prop.



## Setting Up lite server


```
curl https://codeload.github.com/howtographql/react-apollo/tar.gz/starter | tar -xz --strip=1 react-apollo-starter/server
```



- ```prisma```: This directory holds all the files that relate to our Prisma setup. Prisma Client is used to access the database in our GraphQL resolvers (similar to an ORM).

  - ```schema.prisma``` defines our data model for the project. It uses the Prisma Schema Language to define the shape of our databases tables and the relations between them.
  - ```dev.db``` is a SQLite database that will be used to store and retrieve data for this tutorial

-  ```src```: This directory holds the source files for our GraphQL server.

  - ```schema.graphql``` contains our application schema. The application schema defines the GraphQL operations we can send from the frontend. Weâ€™ll take a closer look at this file in just a bit.
  - ```resolvers``` contains the resolver functions for the operations defined in the application schema.
  - ```index.js``` is the entry point for our GraphQL server.











# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
